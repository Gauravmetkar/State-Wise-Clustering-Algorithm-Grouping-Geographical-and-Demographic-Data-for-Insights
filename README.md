The State-Wise Clustering Algorithm is designed to perform clustering on geographical and demographic data from Indian states. This algorithm groups states based on various features such as
latitude, longitude, and language, using unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify patterns and correlations among the states.
This project demonstrates the use of clustering algorithms (like K-means or DBSCAN) to group states in a way that can provide valuable insights for analysis, policy-making, and business
strategy.

Features:
Clusters states based on geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and linguistic data.
Uses popular machine learning algorithms such as K-means clustering or DBSCAN.
Provides valuable insights into regional patterns and correlations across states.
Simple, clean visualization of clusters to aid in interpretation.
